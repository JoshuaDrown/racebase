initial idea: make a database for local mountain bike race results.
	use mysql?
	

tables:
	racers
		firstname
		lastname
		agegroup
		category

	venues
		lat
		lon
		laplength
		altitude
		elevation gain
		difficulty rating

	race
		venue
		date
		category
		distance
		name

	results
		firstname
		lastname
		agegroup
		category
		race
		position
		time

	weather (would like to be able to analyze results against the weather)
		date
		temp
		humidity
		winddirection
		precip
		%cloudcover
		lat
		lon
